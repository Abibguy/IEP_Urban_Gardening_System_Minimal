# IEP_Urban_Gardening_System_Minimal
An Arduino-based environmental monitoring and automation system tailored for urban gardening. Powered by the RichShield sensor suite, this project continuously monitors key greenhouse variables such as temperature, humidity, and light levels to help maintain optimal conditions for plant growth in compact urban spaces.
